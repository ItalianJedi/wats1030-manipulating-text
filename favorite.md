My favorite text editor so far has to be vi. It seems closest to the command line and moving around and editing seems to be the easiest. What I didn't like was the learning curve of it but after awhile it was easy for me to use i to edit the file and :wq to save and exit. I also like the percentage at the bottom of the screen. It was helpful when I was doing the search for Vishta and Kuno so I knew when I was coming to the bottom of the screen. Also the warning that I was coming to the bottom of the screen helped too.
